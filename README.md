Peptide Tools
=============

This is a simple web app written in Flask and Python.
Currently, its purpose is to take an amino acid chain written in 1-letter representation and
converts it to its 3-letter representation equivalent. 

There are other apps out there that do something similar and may have more features but this 
one is written and customized specifically for American Peptide Co., Inc. and their output
requirments.

Any future tools developed on this site will be per request.
